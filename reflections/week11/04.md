## Questions

Write a review and reflection of your experiences in this course, as this is the last lecture before your `final project`, what are your concerns, how do you plan to manage your time, what have you enjoyed most about the course up to this point.

This course as a whole was a great experience. Looking back on day one and how much I knew compared to 3 months later is crazy. I learned to love the struggle and face every challenge in this cohort head on. I learned a lot about my learning style and how i can learn best. I'm excited as well as nervous to get my final. I plan to time box is issues and really just put my head down and finish this one final project.
