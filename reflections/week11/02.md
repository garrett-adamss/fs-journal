## Questions

1. What is the difference between a `primary key` and a `foreign key`

Primary keys are pieces of unique information that are used to identify records on a table. Foreign keys are used to reference data on another table.

2. What is an `Alias`?

Alias are just nicknames that you give tables in sql. 

3. Demonstrate how you would query a join statement that would get all of a doctors patients from the following collections:

```SQL
CREATE TABLE doctors (
  id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  -- CODE OMITTED
  PRIMARY KEY (id)
)

CREATE TABLE patients (
  id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  -- CODE OMITTED
  PRIMARY KEY (id)
)

CREATE TABLE doctors (
  id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  doctorId INT NOT NULL,
  patientId INT NOT NULL,

  FOREIGN KEY (doctorId)
    REFERENCES doctors(id),
  FOREIGN KEY (patientId)
    REFERENCES patients(id),
)

SELECT 
d.*
p.*
FROM doctor d AND patient p
JOIN  d.id ON p.id = s.patientId

```
