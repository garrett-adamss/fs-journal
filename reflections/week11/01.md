## Questions

1. What does Inheritance accomplish for us in C#?

It helps developers define a relationship between two classes. 

2. How does Member inheritance work in C#? Does a class inherit all members of the base class?

The derived class is inherited from the base class, the base class doesn't have all that the derived class does.

3. How does accessibility affect inheritance?

Private classes are not visible by the parent class, protected members are only visible in a child class, internal members are visible in derived classes located in the same assembly as the parent class, and public members are apart of the public interface of the child class.
