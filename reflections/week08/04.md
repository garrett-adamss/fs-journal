## Questions

1. What are the three main types of testing we can accomplish in Vue? What does each method provide?

Three main types of testing  in Vue are First-class error reporting(try/catch), vue testing library(a set of tools to test components in vue), and vue test utils(official low level component testing)

2. What testing method do you think is the most useful? Why?

I think that the most useful is first-class error reporting, this allows the dev to catch error as they are being created and fix them during development

3. What testing method do you think is the least useful? Why?

I think that the vue test utils sounds the least useful just because it sounds the same as the vue testing library just low-level
