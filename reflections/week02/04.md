## Questions

1. What are the benefits of making a plan before starting to just write the code?

My favorite benefit of making a plan before starting to write code is so you have a template to work off of. This allows me to be way more efficient with my time when coding. 

2. How do you find answers when you are stuck?

First step is to debug yourself and try to find what and why things are not working

3. From the entire article what are your biggest takeaways?

My biggest take away was talking about making existing code worse. Always test small segments of your code as you go, and this will prevent you from having to do a lot of debugging
