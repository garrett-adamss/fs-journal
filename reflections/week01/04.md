## Questions

1. What is the purpose of wire-framing? 

Wire-framing is a rough draft of a website without any code. This allows product concepts to be created so you can visualize were content is going to be place on the page and a draft of the user experience.

2. What are the different levels of detail in wire-frames and why is each one useful?

The different levels of wire-frames are low-fidelity, mid-fidelity, and high-fidelity. Each of these have different levels of detail allowing devs to brainstorm and visualize concepts.

3. Do you think wire-frames are worth the Time, Energy, and Effort that they require? Why or Why not?

Yes i think that wire-frames are worth the effort they take. Personally having a visual template I can use while coding and developing really helps me.
