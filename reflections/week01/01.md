## Questions

1. In your own words, why do we use Git?

Git is a distribution system that allows you as well as other developers to work on code in parallel development. 
Git also allows you to view older version of your code as it saves pervious version in case of a code breaking 
bug. These tools are useful for productivity and collaboration on projects.

2. What are the benefits of having multiple branches?

One of the best benefits of having multiple branches is the ability to have parallel development on the same project 
allowing for you to test code without losing the original. It also allows you to test out entire features while still having the main branch.


3. What is the difference between Git and GitHub

Git is a local repository on your own system. GitHub is a remote repository for our code. If you push 
your code out to GitHub it allows multiple developers to work on the same project and have the same 
source code without having to share your local files with each developer individually.
