## Questions

1. What is a List in C#?

A list is a generic type that can have a list of any type needed

2. What List methods seem like you might use them often? Why?

I think some methods I will use often are the .Add, .Contains, and the .Clear. I think these 3 methods alone can allow me to do a lot with a list. 

3. How would you retrieve an item from a list? What method could you use?

One method you can use is the .Contains method to search the list.
