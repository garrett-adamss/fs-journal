## Questions

1. What is an Enum, and what are some use cases for them?

Enums are unique types that allow you to symbolic names to integral values.

2. How can you modify an Enum?

You can modify an Enum by creating a public enum outside the class and making the decision based on the enum value

3. How have you used Enums in your afternoon lab projects this far?(if you have not yet, give an example of how you could)

I haven't yet but one way you can use an enum is for values that you know are going to be changing and creating a enum to change those values in a class
